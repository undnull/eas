These files are messages from the game Black Mesa
encoded with the valid SAME headers and SAME EOM bursts.

WARNING WARNING WARNING
THESE SOUND FILES CONTAIN VALID SAME HEADER DATA AND MAY TRIGGER

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TRANSMIT THESE SOUND FILES ANYWHERE
NEAR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS DOING SO IS ILLEGAL AND MAY
LEAD TO VARIOUS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU

This one is just to be sure that if someone stupid enough tries
to transmit those files, I am not getting arrested:

The original game features three EAS messages throughout
the gamplay as a quick look at the events happening outside
of the research facility. However those messages have SAME
headers that do not reflect the situation (RWS - Required
Weekly Test for Rhode Island, obviously not an EVI - Evacuation
Immediate for New Mexico) as well as lacking the EOM bursts (which,
to my understanding actually is dangerous for some EAS equipment IRL).

So I decided to use my encoder to generate valid EAS messages
for those in-game moments.

If you, the reader of this are a level designer @ Crowbar Collective,
feel free to use those as a replacement for existing sound files;
I think it would be a nifty easter egg to have valid SAME headers there.
